# PowerBI_Practical_Exam_Kemo_Dibassy


## Backgroud

This Power BI project fulfills the requirements of our Business Intelligence and Visualization course during the Summer Semester 2025. As part of the assignment, we analyzed the AdventureWorks sales dataset to extract meaningful insights and trends. Using Power BI, we transformed the sales data into an interactive dashboard, applying data cleaning, modeling, and visualization techniques to highlight key performance metrics.


## My approach to the task
I approach the exam task by thoroughly exploring the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and relationships. I identified the different data types present such as numerical, categorical, and date fields and assessed how they connected across tables. After gaining a clear understanding of the data, I moved to the transformation phase, where I cleaned and prepared the dataset by correcting data types, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency. Next, I created proper data model relationships to enable accurate analysis. Finally, I designed interactive dashboards with visualizations, applying filters to highlight key insights and trends.
